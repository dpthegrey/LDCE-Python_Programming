# What is socket? How to create a socket in python?
"""
Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communication channel.
Sockets may communicate within a process, 
between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.

Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on.
The socket library provides provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as generic interface for handling the rest.
